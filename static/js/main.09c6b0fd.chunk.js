MacMillan developed his bike from an older wheeled vehicle, called a "hobby horse".This was a wooden horse with two wheels.The rider sat on the horse, and pushed the vehicle along with his feet.It was not a very fast or safe vehicle, since it had no steering and no brakes.'},{id:"aa3",img:"/img/camera.jpg",title:"World First Digital Camera",post:"Its hard to believe that digital cameras have been in existence for over four decades, but thanks to one creative engineer, we have one of the most ubiquitous pieces of modern technology.Hear the story of the birth of our beloved cameras from the inventor himself. Way back in 1974, a young engineer at Kodak named Steven Sasson was given a project: examining the imaging performance of CCDs(charge- coupled devices).Sasson quickly realized the potential of the device, and about a year later, he took the first digital camera image ever.His device had a resolution of 0.01 megapixels, weighed 8 pounds, and took 23 seconds to record a single image to a cassette tape."}],Article2:[{id:"ba1",img:"/img/conf.jpg",title:"How to Cover Meetings",post:"Pick a few key issues on the agenda that you will focus on.

There is a great deal of talk and endeavour to protect nature, the animals, the birds, the whales and dolphins, to clean the polluted rivers, lakes, fields and so on. Nature is not put together by thought, as religion and belief are. Nature is the tiger, that extraordinary animal with its energy, its great sense of power. Nature is the solitary tree in the field, the meadows and the grove; it is that squirrel shyly hiding behind a bough. Nature is the ant, the bee and all the living things of the earth. Nature is the river, not a particular river, whether the Ganga, the Thames or the Mississippi. Nature is those mountains, snow-clad, with dark blue valleys and range of hills meeting the sea. The universe is part of nature. One must have a feeling for all this, not destroy it, not kill for one\u2019s pleasure or one\u2019s table. We do kill cabbages, the vegetables we eat, but one must draw the line somewhere. If you do not eat vegetables, how will you live?

Now-a-days, students think that student life is very easy and full of fun today especially college life of the students. But the future of students depend upon their achievements in student life because the fun-loving students of today used smart ways to get good marks in examination which is shown in my story. This is as follows:- Ashish and Amit were studying in the college.Both were classmates as well as roommates in the hostel room.Ashish was a studious boy but Amit was a fun- loving boy and was not serious in studies.Ashish used to study regularly to get good marks in exams whereas Amit was not serious in studies and used to study \u201cGuess Paper\u201d, \u201cOne - day Series \u201c, etc.to get good marks in exams."}],Article4:{id:"ba2",img:"/img/conf.jpg",title:"How to Cover Meetings",post:"Pick a few key issues on the agenda that you will focus on.
